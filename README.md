# weather-app

a weather app using open meteo API. Had some moderate debugging issues, mostly based around formatting of day/time rendering to the UI, and a few other simple, but hard-to-spot errors (type-o's, silly file directory mishaps, etc). App has a nice simple U/I. Thanks to Web Dev Simplified for this fun project!
